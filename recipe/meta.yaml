  summary: 'A Python 3 implementation of LoOP: Local Outlier Probabilities.'
  description: |
    PyNomaly is a Python 3 implementation of LoOP (Local Outlier Probabilities).
    LoOP is a local density based outlier detection method by Kriegel, KrÃ¶ger,
    Schubert, and Zimek which provides outlier scores in the range of [0,1] that
    are directly interpretable as the probability of a sample being an outlier.
